# Agent guide — terraform-rhcs-rosa-classic

This repository is the **ROSA Classic** Terraform module. The sibling **ROSA HCP** module is [`terraform-rhcs-rosa-hcp`](https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-rhcs-rosa-hcp) — do not mix architectures.

## Where rules live

| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) | Hard, stable guardrails (architecture boundaries, provider/version constraints, variable conventions, credentials/secrets) |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Command and procedure authority (fmt, verify, docs generation, test execution, commit format, changelog automation) |
| This file | Process narrative, security expectations, and decision workflow for agents |

Thin entrypoints [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`GEMINI.md`](GEMINI.md) only point here so we do not duplicate content.

## HashiCorp Terraform skills

Upstream skills live under:

**https://github.com/hashicorp/agent-skills/tree/main/terraform**

Important: if you encounter a conflict between the skills below and this repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` takes precedence.

Useful skills for this codebase:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| **terraform-style-guide** | Formatting HCL, variable/output layout, naming |
| **terraform-test** | Adding or changing `*.tftest.hcl`, mocks, `terraform test` |
| **refactor-module** | Splitting modules, clarifying interfaces, safe refactors |

**How to use them**

1. Open the skill’s `SKILL.md` in the repo (or your local skills mirror).
2. Apply its workflow to the task (style, tests, or refactor) instead of inventing patterns.
3. Still respect this repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` and **root `versions.tf`** constraints.

## Provider & versions

- [`terraform-redhat/rhcs`](https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs) defines resource schemas — mirror them in variables and docs.
- Root **`versions.tf`** declares the minimum **Terraform CLI** (currently **>= 1.5.7**) and the minimum **rhcs** and **aws** providers for **all** submodules.
- To prevent technical debt, Renovate automatically opens Pull Requests to bump these root constraints whenever a new provider version is released, keeping our baseline continuously updated.
- Submodule **`terraform test`** files under **`modules/*/tests/`** may use **`mock_provider`** and require a **newer** Terraform CLI than the module minimum (see **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**); CI runs tests with a pinned current release.

## Architecture reference

- [AWS — ROSA, HCP, and Classic comparison](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/rosa-architecture-models.html#rosa-architecture-differences)

## Security

**Canonical baseline** (must / must-not): [`.cursor/rules/rosa-classic-terraform.mdc`](.cursor/rules/rosa-classic-terraform.mdc) — section **Security**. If anything below conflicts with that file or with **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**, follow those sources.

**Agent-oriented checks** when editing Terraform, **`examples/`**, and tests:

- Do **not** hard code secrets, API keys, or long-lived AWS access keys in Terraform, examples, or tests. Prefer patterns in existing **`examples/`** and Red Hat documentation (STS, OIDC, IRSA, short-lived credentials).
- Use **`sensitive`** on variables and outputs where values must not appear in logs or casual `terraform show` output; avoid echoing secrets in `local` values used only for debugging.
- Do not add logging, outputs, or comments that expose credentials or session tokens.

## CI client Dockerfile (Prow)

The root **`Dockerfile`** builds the **OpenShift Prow** client image (`terraform-rhcs-rosa-classic-clients`). Treat it as a **minimal supply-chain surface**: include **only** what presubmit jobs in [`openshift/release`](https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/ci-operator/config/terraform-redhat/terraform-rhcs-rosa-classic) need today (`make verify`, `make verify-gen`, `make run-example`, and the tools behind `make pre-push-checks`). The image pins the newest Terraform release (`TERRAFORM_VERSION`); module minimum compatibility is enforced separately by GitHub Actions **`verify-min-terraform.yml`** (see **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**).

When changing the Dockerfile:

- **Minimize attack surface** — prefer **`ubi-minimal`** with a **pinned** minor tag (not `:latest`); do not add OS packages, compilers, or CLIs “for convenience” without a job that uses them. The client image runs as **root** so Prow/ci-operator can write to the mounted repo workspace (`make verify`, `make verify-gen`); do not add a non-root `USER` without coordinating `openshift/release` workspace ownership.
- **Pin versions** — base image, AWS CLI, ROSA CLI, Terraform, and Makefile tools; use **`# renovate:`** comments and existing patterns (`hack/install-release-tool.sh` release binaries, not `go install`, unless unavoidable). AWS CLI zips are verified with **`gpg --verify`** against **`hack/aws-cli-public-key.asc`** and the matching **`.sig`** from `awscli.amazonaws.com` ([install guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)). ROSA **`rosa-linux.tar.gz`** is verified with **`sha256sum -c`** against **`sha256sum.txt`** from `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/cgw/rosa/<ROSA_VERSION>/`.
- **Avoid bloat** — the image is tool-heavy (Terraform, AWS CLI, ROSA, lint binaries); do not grow it with extra runtimes, caches, or unrelated utilities. Prefer release tarballs over full language SDKs in the final image.
- **Security scans** — `make security-check` is separate from `make pre-push-checks`; fix findings or document narrow suppressions per the **Gitleaks** and **Checkov** sections below.

## Gitleaks (secret detection)

Repo config: root **`.gitleaks.toml`** (extends default rules; allowlists `*.tftest` harness placeholders and `bin/` / `.terraform/` caches). Install with `make security-check-bin` or `make gitleaks`. `make security-check` runs **`gitleaks detect --no-git`** (current tree only, not git history) before Checkov. References: [Gitleaks README](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/README.md).

When **`make security-check`** reports a Gitleaks finding, treat it as a real secret risk unless the match is a documented mock in test code covered by the allowlist. Do not commit credentials, tokens, or kubeconfigs; rotate anything that was exposed.

## Checkov (Terraform security)

Repo config: root **`checkov.yaml`** (framework, skip paths, **HIGH**/**CRITICAL** hard-fail). Install with `make security-check-bin`. `hack/install-release-tool.sh` verifies each Checkov zip against **`hack/checksums/checkov-<version>.sha256sums`** (upstream releases do not ship checksums — refresh that file when **`CHECKOV_VERSION`** changes). `make security-check` passes **`--skip-download`** so Checkov does not call Prisma Cloud (no `BC_API_KEY` required). **`modules/rosa-cluster-classic/main.tf`** is skipped because Checkov cannot parse its multiline lifecycle preconditions (Terraform **`make verify`** still validates it). References: [Checkov CLI](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html).

When **`make security-check`** reports a finding (check IDs like **`CKV_AWS_*`**, **`CKV2_AWS_*`**):

1. **Prefer fixing** the HCL (least privilege, encryption, IMDSv2, etc.).
2. If a skip is required, add **`#checkov:skip=<CKV_ID>:<reason>`** on the line **immediately above** the flagged resource, with a short justification (narrow scope).
3. Use **`skip-check`** entries in **`checkov.yaml`** only when inline suppression is not possible — one ID per entry with a comment explaining why.
4. **Remove stale suppressions** — when code or Checkov no longer reports a check, delete the matching `#checkov:skip` comment or **`checkov.yaml`** `skip-check` entry so drift does not hide new findings.

## Critical module guardrails

- **Breaking changes:** Do **not** change existing variable names or types without a migration plan (refactor-module skill).
- **Classic specifics:** Always verify if a feature applies to **Classic** compared to **HCP**. This repo centers on **`rhcs_cluster_rosa_classic`** and related Classic resources — do not copy HCP-only resource shapes from the HCP module.

## Workflow logic for agents

When asked to add a feature, the agent should follow this internal loop:

1. **Verify provider support:** Check the provider schema/docs for the version range in root `versions.tf`.
2. **Check `versions.tf`:** Does this require a provider bump? If yes, modify the root `versions.tf` first.
3. **Variable standard:** Add variables using the description / type / default order. Ensure descriptions match the upstream provider docs.
4. **Docs and tests:** Apply the required commands and verification steps from **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**.
5. **Security:** Follow **Security** above (canonical rules in `.cursor/rules` first, then the agent-oriented bullets).

## Testing expectations

New features should include a new `.tftest.hcl` file or an update to an existing one when module behavior changes.

Use mocks for AWS and RHCS resources to verify logic without requiring live credentials.

Before opening a PR, `make pre-push-checks` must pass locally; see **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** for commands and pass/fail criteria.
